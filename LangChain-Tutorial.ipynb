Document(page_content='雷文防雷資訊頁~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 雷文 主文分隔線 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~我是偶然看到Youtube的預告才想要看這部片的，爬了本板以後發現有很多致敬(?)各大遊戲的海報，更讓我想看。首先，我很喜歡脫稿玩家的原文名稱「Free Guy」的雙關。Free一詞有形容詞跟動詞的解釋方法，形容詞有自由的、無拘束的；動詞則有解放的意思整部電影劇情就是讓「Guy(台譯：蓋依)」這個人能夠自由地成為一個人工智慧在虛擬世界生活。這部電影不需要很多遊戲的理解，但如果對於遊戲的認識夠多，裡面長的像GTA的自由世界架構，像是當初GTAVC(俠盜列車手：罪惡都市)或早期遊戲這樣的補血機制。GTAV出現的搶劫任務，一般RPG常出現無聊的找東西任務等等都會使人感到驚喜。還有對戰時可以瞬間拿出的武器，長的像GTAV的車庫，傳送門2的Portal Gun(傳送槍)、G mod跟Half Life系列的重力槍、星際大戰的Light Saber(光劍)，無一不引起對於遊戲玩家的懷念，並想起甚麼時候可以數到3。其中也請到包含jacksepticeye等知名Youtuber，讓我突然覺得很親近，還搞出跟YT直播一樣的畫面，時不時露出的各家電競廠商的產品(我看到的包括Razer的耳機兩種、筆電；HyperX的耳機；DXRacer電競椅；各種七彩霓虹燈的自組電腦)甚至連Gawr Gura講的「Apex Predator」都拿來當梗(但我真的不確定是不是Gura先講的)，也直言不諱的講到Twitch跟Youtube，但可惜台灣翻譯沒有直接寫出這兩個直播平台的名字。真的是讓一個很愛玩遊戲、愛看人家玩遊戲的我感到親近的電影。但是對於沒有上述的插入內容，或許在一般人眼中只是一部CG效果不錯的影片。這跟我前幾年在威秀看4DX3D的Ready Player One有一樣的親近感，但聽說當時該片對於原著改編很大。非常推薦給有玩遊戲，尤其是可以自由殺人(?)的開放式砂盒遊戲的人去看這部影片。而這次在大直美麗華IMAX看，真的觀影體驗很好，要來研究國外有沒有原生IMAX電影院了Swat 筆電參號機(Swat-NB003)→https://i.imgur.com/qsPVDul.png品名 ASUS ROG Strix G713QM LCD: 17.3\"
