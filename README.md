# Notes

- The goal is to provide an introductory understanding of the use cases of LangChain.

- This notebook is based on the [LangChain Tutorial](https://github.com/gkamradt/langchain-tutorials) (by Greg Kamradt) and the LangChain [Documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/).

- The default models (`davinci-003` and `gpt-3.5-turbo`) are used throughout the notebook; `gpt-4.0` would surely get better results.

- A   <mark>paid</mark> `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required to run the code blocks involving LLMs.
