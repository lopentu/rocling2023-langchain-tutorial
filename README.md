# rocling2023-langchain-tutorial

- This notebook is based on the [LangChain Tutorial](https://github.com/gkamradt/langchain-tutorials) (by Greg Kamradt) and the Official LangChain [Documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/).
- The goal is to provide an introductory understanding of the use cases of LangChain.
- The default models (davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo) are used throughout the notebook; using GPT-4 would no doubt get better results.
- A  <mark>paid</mark>` OPENAI_API_KEY` is required throughout the notebook.
